# Data Analysis #1
The work was created as a simple project that uses the Pandas library for data manipulation.

We receive data from the official website of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, [noaa.gov](https://www.noaa.gov/))

Then we clean the dataset and get the necessary information from it.

We collect the following data:
- Vegetation Condition Index (VCI)
- Temperature Condition Index (TCI)
- Vegetation Health Index (VHI)

We also have 25 regions of Ukraine in which these indicators are available to us. For the task, you need to reassign other indexes to the regions.
